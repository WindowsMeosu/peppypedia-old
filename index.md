Today: the first year anniversary peppypedia!
Yester: Starting September 22 (tomorrow), peppypedia will become a year old. On the night of tomorrow, I'll do a simple project tease as well as batch commits to peppypedia-old. To those who supported this project (literally 2 people), thank you. - Milo/Windows Me. (psst, thank you for reading this on peppypedia-old :3.)
