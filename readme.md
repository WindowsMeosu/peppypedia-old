# peppypedia
wikipedia but for osu!

we have a IRC channel at libera.chat called ##peppypedia for any discussions.
KittenBot (the IRC bot) will not be open-source until I finish developing it.. as for now, it is hosted on a seperate server (with parts of code I do and don't own) until I merge it to the finished and fully developed repo.
